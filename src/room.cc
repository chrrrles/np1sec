 * - Receive a leave requet -> make a new session immediately with session id.
 * - Receive a message with wrong sid -> ignore.
 *
 * User not in the active session:
 * - UserState join-> just send join to room without session
 * - receive with existing sid -> goes to sid.
 * - receive with non-existing sid -> generate a new session.
 *
 * Other messages should be deligated this way
 * using
         the following procedure:
           1. If the message has sid:
                if there is a live session with that sid, deligate
                to that session
                else if the message has sid but session with such
                sid does not exists or the session is dead
                   if the room has active session, give it to the active sesssion of the room
                   else 
                      make a new session for that room and deligate it to it 
                      (but it is a sort of error, ignore the message. Join message doesn't have                    sid)

           2. If the message doesn't have sid, it is a join message
                if the room has active session
                  deligate it to the active session.
